## Overview
[Payback](https://payback-app-rjwr.onrender.com/docs#) is a roommate expense tracking system. This system will keep track of a household group made up of users, and users can add their expenses for groceries, rent, furniture, staples, etc... The group can decide what percentage is paid by who, at which point the money due to each other user for their expense is decided, based on who bought what.

Payback is built using ReactJS and a postgres database in the backend to keep track of saved expenses. Users are able to sign up to create an account and have the backend of the webapp keep track of group expenses.
