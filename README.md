_By Suhanth Alluri (alluri), Saba Hakimi (sahakimi), Liam Kbidy (lkbidy), Maxwell Silver (msilve08)_  

## Overview
ToDone is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Users can also mark tasks as complete and view their completed tasks.  
ToDone is built using ReactJS and a postgres database in the backend to keep
track of saved user todos.  
Users are able to sign up to create an account and have the backend of the webapp
keep track of their todos.

## Dream State
Once the main todo-list aspect of the webapp is done, integrating the Canvas 
API to allow users to add assignments to their to-do list will become a possibility.

### Usage
This project uses `yarn`  
Use:
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the server
