# ToDone
_By Suhanth Alluri, Saba Hakimi, Liam Kbidy, Max Silver_  

## Overview
ToDone is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Users can also mark tasks as complete and view their completed tasks.  
ToDone is built using ReactJS and a postgres database in the backend.  

## Dream State
Once the main todo-list aspect of the webapp is done, integrating the Canvas 
API to allow users to add assignments to their to-do list will become a possibility.

### Usage
This project uses `yarn`  
Use:
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the server
