### Updating Trip Line Item:
Lost Updates: If two transactions concurrently read and then update a line item, one of the updates could overwrite the other, leading to a loss of data. To prevent this, we could set it to Serializable isolation level, in which transactions are executed in a way that provides the illusion that they are the only transactions interacting with the data. This prevents phenomena like lost updates by ensuring that the updates are not overwritten by other transactions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1
    participant Database
    participant T2

    T1->>Database: Read value (10)
    T2->>Database: Read value (10)
    T1->>Database: Update value to 15
    T1->>Database: Commit change
    T2->>Database: Update value to 12
    T2->>Database: Commit change
    Note right of Database: Update from T1 is lost
```

### Search Line Items
Phantom Reads: This phenomenon, possible in 'REPEATABLE READ' isolation, refers to a transaction noticing new rows being added to the dataset it has queried. In your case, if the transaction involves reading groups or members and then repeats this read, it might find new groups or members that were not present in the initial read. To prevent this phenomenon, the isolation level has to be set to Serializable.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Transaction 1
    participant DB as Database
    participant T2 as Transaction 2

    Note over T1, DB: Transaction 1 begins
    T1->>DB: Read groups/members
    Note over DB: Returns initial dataset

    T2->>DB: Inserts new rows
    
    T1->>DB: Repeat Read groups/members
    Note over DB: Returns dataset with new rows
    Note over T1, DB: Transaction 1 notices new rows (Phantom Reads)
```

### List Expenses
Dirty Reads: If this endpoint retrieves a list of expenses while another transaction is adding, updating, or deleting an expense, and that transaction is rolled back, it could lead to dirty reads. Since the default isolation level in postgres is Read Committed, this phenomena will be prevented.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1
    participant Database
    participant T2

    T1->>Database: Start transaction
    T1->>Database: Update value from 10 to 15
    T2->>Database: Read value (gets 15)
    T1->>Database: Rollback transaction (revert to 10)
    Note right of T2: T2 has dirty read (value 15)
```
