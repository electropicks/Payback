Lost Updates: If two transactions concurrently read and then update a line item, one of the updates could overwrite the other, leading to a loss of data.

Integrity Constraint Violations: Without proper concurrency control, simultaneous attempts to create groups could lead to violations of database integrity constraints, such as unique constraints on group names.

Dirty Reads: If a transaction reads data that is being concurrently modified by another transaction and that second transaction later rolls back, the first transaction will have read data that was never committed, leading to inconsistencies.
